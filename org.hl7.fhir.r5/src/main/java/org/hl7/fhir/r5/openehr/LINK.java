/**
 * The LINK type defines a logical relationship between two items, such as two ENTRYs or an ENTRY and a COMPOSITION. Links can be used across compositions, and across EHRs. Links can potentially be used between interior (i.e. non archetype root) nodes, although this probably should be prevented in archetypes. Multiple LINKs can be attached to the root object of any LINK structure to give the effect of a 1â†’N link. 1:1 and 1:N relationships between LINK content elements (e.g. ENTRYs) can be expressed by using one, or more than one, respectively, LINKs. Chains of links can be used to see problem threads or other logical groupings of items. Links should be between LINK structures only, i.e. between objects representing complete domain concepts because relationships between sub-elements of whole concepts are not necessarily meaningful, and may be downright confusing. Sensible links only exist between whole ENTRYs, SECTIONs, COMPOSITIONs and so on.
