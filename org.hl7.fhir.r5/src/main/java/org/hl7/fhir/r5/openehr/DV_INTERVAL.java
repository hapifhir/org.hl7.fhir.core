/**
 * Generic class defining an interval (i.e. range) of a comparable type. An interval is a contiguous subrange of a comparable base type. Used to define intervals of dates, times, quantities (whose units match) and so on. The type parameter, T, must be a descendant of the type DV_ORDERED, which is necessary (but not sufficient) for instances to be compared (strictly_comparable is also needed).

Without the DV_INTERVAL class, quite a few more DV_ classes would be needed to express logical intervals, namely interval versions of all the date/time classes, and of quantity classes. Further, it allows the semantics of intervals to be stated in one place unequivocally, including the conditions for strict comparison.
