Usage: java -jar [validator].jar (parameters)

The FHIR validation tool validates a FHIR resource or bundle.
The validation tool compares a resource against the base definitions and any
profiles declared in the resource (Resource.meta.profile) or specified on the 
command line

The FHIR validation tool validates a FHIR resource or bundle. Syntax and content is checked 
against the specification and other profiles as specified. 

* XML & Json (FHIR versions {{XML_AND_JSON_FHIR_VERSIONS}})
* Turtle (FHIR versions {{TURTLE_FHIR_VERSIONS}})

If requested, instances will also be verified against the appropriate schema W3C
XML Schema, JSON schema or ShEx, as appropriate

The following parameters are supported:

[source]: a file, url, directory or pattern for resources to validate.
       At least one source must be declared. If there is more than one source or
    if the source is other than a single file or url and the output parameter is
    used, results will be provided as a Bundle.
       Patterns are limited to a directory followed by a filename with an
    embedded asterisk.  E.g. foo*-examples.xml or someresource.*, etc.
-version [ver]: The FHIR version to use.
       This can only appear once.
       valid values {{FHIR_MAJOR_VERSIONS}} or {{FHIR_MINOR_VERSIONS}}
       Default value is {{FHIR_CURRENT_VERSION}}
-ig [package|file|folder|url]: an IG or profile definition to load.
       Can be the URL of an implementation guide or a package ([id]-[ver]) for a
    built implementation guide or a local folder that contains a set of
    conformance resources.
       If you would like to load the latest unreleased version of the
    implementation guide or package, please define the version as '#current'.
       If no version is provided, the latest version in the package cache will
    be used, or if no such cached package is available, the PackageCacheManager
    will load the latest from the the online package repo.
       If you want the implementation guide to be loaded for a specific version
    of FHIR, you can prefix the IG with the appropriate version in square
    brackets ([[fhirVer]][id]-[igVer]).
       No default value. This parameter can appear any number of times
-tx [url]: the [base] url of a FHIR terminology service
      Default value is http://tx.fhir.org. This parameter can appear once
      To run without terminology value, specific n/a as the URL
-txLog [file]: Produce a log of the terminology server operations in [file]
       Default value is not to produce a log
-profile [url]: the canonical URL to validate against (same as if it was 
     specified in Resource.meta.profile).
        If no profile is specified, the resource is validated against the base
     specification. This parameter can appear any number of times.
        Note: the profile (and it's dependencies) have to be made available
     through one of the -ig parameters. Note that package dependencies will 
     automatically be resolved
-showReferenceMessages
        Includes validation messages resulting from validating target resources
     against profiles defined on a reference.  This increases the volume of 
     validation messages, but may allow easier debugging.  If not specified,
     then only a high-level message indicating that the referenced item wasn't
     valid against the listed profile(s) will be provided.
-questionnaire mode: what to do when validating QuestionnaireResponse resources
     * none (default): just ignore the questionnaire reference
     * required: check that the QuestionnaireResponse has a questionnaire and
       validate against it
     * check: if the QuestionnaireResponse has a questionnaire, validate
       against it
        The questionnaire must be loaded using the -ig parameter
     which specifies the location of a questionnaire. If provided, then the
     validator will validate any QuestionnaireResponse that claims to match the
     Questionnaire against it no default value. This parameter can appear any
     number of times
-output [file]: a filename for the results (OperationOutcome)
        Default: results are sent to the std out.
-outputSuffix [string]: used in -convert and -snapshot to deal with
        one or more result files (where -output can only have one)
-watch-mode [mode]:
        Specify that the validator remain running and re-validate when any 
     of the validated files changes. The validator has to be terminated with 
     ctrl-c etc in this mode.
     This parameter can have one of the following values:
      * none: the default - don't wait, just stop when finished
      * single: when any of the validated files changes, re-validate it
      * all: when any of the validated files changes, re-validate all of them
     All is useful when the content includes internal dependencies e.g. 
     a profile and it's value sets. Watch Mode has two additional parameters:
-watch-scan-delay (ms)
       Control how often the validator looks at the content to decide to run again
     Default 1000 
-watch-settle-time (ms)
       Control how long the validator waits before seeing a change, and revalidating
     Default 100
-debug-log [file]: a filename for a debug log
        Logs debug level messages about the loading/validation process to the
        specified file. This parameter will be ignored if -trace-log is used.
-trace-log [file]: a filename for a trace log
        Logs trace and debug level messages about the loading/validation process
        to the specified file. This parameter overrides -debug-log parameter if
        both are used.
-recurse
        Look in subfolders when -ig refers to a folder
-locale
        Specifies the locale/language of the validation result messages (eg.:
     de-DE
-sct
     Specify the edition of SNOMED CT to use. Valid Choices:
       intl | us | uk | au | nl | ca | se | dk | es
     tx.fhir.org only supports a subset. To add to this list or tx.fhir.org ask
     on https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179202-terminology
-native: use schema for validation as well
     * XML: w3c schema+schematron
     * JSON: json.schema
     * RDF: SHEX
     Default: false
-language: [lang] The language to use when validating coding displays - same
    value as for xml:lang
       Not used if the resource specifies language
    Default: no specified language
-extension: Controls how extensions are validated by the validator. The value
    for this parameter is a URL for a domain from which extensions will be
    allowed. By default, unknown extensions are prohibited, but can be allowed
    by using the value 'any' (e.g. -extension any). This parameter can repeat
    any number of times.
-hintAboutNonMustSupport: If present, raise hints if the instance contains data
    elements that are not marked as mustSupport=true.  Useful to identify
    elements included that may be ignored by recipients
-assumeValidRestReferences: If present, assume that URLs that reference
    resources follow the RESTful URI pattern and it is safe to infer the type
    from the URL
-security-checks: If present, check that string content doesn't include any html
    -like tags that might create problems downstream (though all external input
    must always be santized by escaping for either html or sql)

The validator also supports the param -proxy=[address]:[port] for if you use a
proxy

Parameters can appear in any order
