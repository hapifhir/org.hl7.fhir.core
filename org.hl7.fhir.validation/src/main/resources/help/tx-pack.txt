You can use the validator to generate a package containing all the terminology resources for 
an Implementation Guide. To do this, you must provide a specific parameter:

 -tx-pack {package-id}

-tx-pack requires the parameter -output. All parameters:

- output {file|folder}: a named file or folder. If it's a file, it must end with .tgz or .zip
- format xml may be used to specify xml instead of json.
- scope ig|igs|all - which to include value sets etc from dependent IGs or core as well
- expansion-parameters {file} - specifies the expansion parameters to use - this can supply fixed versions for code systems and value sets
