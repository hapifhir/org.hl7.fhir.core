For example, an \"employee\" sensitivity code would make little sense for use outside of a policy domain.   \"Taboo\" would rarely be useful outside of a policy domain unless there are jurisdictional requirements requiring that a provider disclose sensitive information to a patient directly. Sensitivity codes may be more appropriate in a legacy system's Master Files in order to notify those who access a patient's orders and observations about the sensitivity policies that apply.  Newer systems may have a security engine that uses a sensitivity policy's criteria directly. The specializable Sensitivity Act.code may be useful in some scenarious if used in combination with a sensitivity identifier and/or Act.title.","immutable":false,"compose":{"include":[{"system":"http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ActCode","filter":[{"property":"concept","op":"is-a","value":"_InformationSensitivityPolicy"}]}]}}
