These factors include, for example, the Doppler effect that induces optical frequency shift and the change in backscattering due to the particles that are moving in and out of the OCT-probe volume during imaging. The changes in signal frequency cause the changes in both the amplitude and the phase of the OCT signal. Comparison of the complex (amplitude and phase) signal from repeated B-scans at the same location provides an image that has higher contrast in areas of erythrocyte motion.
