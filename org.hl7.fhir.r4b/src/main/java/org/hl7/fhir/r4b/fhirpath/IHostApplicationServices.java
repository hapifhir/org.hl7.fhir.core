/**
 * This interface allows the application making use of a FHIRPathEngine to provide
 * additional services that can be used in the FHIRPath statements. The services fall into
 * two categories: extending the FHIRPath engine with types, constants and functions, and
 * performing work that the FHIRPath engine doesn't know how to do itself
 *
 * Functionality:
 *  * resolveConstant()/resolveConstantType() - register constants
 *  * log() - do something when .log() is used in the FHIRPath statement
 *  * resolveFunction() / checkFunction() / executeFunction() - allow the application to define FHIRPath functions of it's own
 *  * resolveReference() - called when a FHIRPath statement uses 'resolve()' so the host application can attempt to resolve the reference
 *  * resolveValueSet() - called when memberOf() is used
 *  * conformsToProfile() - check that the content conforms to the stated profile. Used by the ValidationEngine - not generally suitable for applications to provide their own interface
 *  * paramIsType() - used when the FHIRPath statement
 *
 *  Note that his used to be called IEvaluationContext in the FHIRPathEngine class, but was renamed
 *  due to a broken interface - see comments at https://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core/releases/tag/6.6.0
