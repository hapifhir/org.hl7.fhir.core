  /**
   * Called before validating a concept in an instance against the terminology sub-system
   * 
   * There's two reasons to use this policy advisor feature:
   *   - save time by not calling the terminology server for validation that don't bring value to the context calling the validation
   *   - suppressing known issues from being listed as a problem
   *   
   * Note that the terminology subsystem has two parts: a mini-terminology server running inside the 
   * validator, and then calling out to an external terminology service (usually tx.fhir.org, though you
   * run your own local copy of this - see https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Running+your+own+copy+of+tx.fhir.org).
   * You can't tell which subsystem will handle the terminology validation directly from the content provided here which
   * subsystem will be called - you'll haev to investigate based on your set up. (matters, since it makes a huge performance 
   * difference, though it also depends on caching, and the impact of caching is also not known at this point)
   *   
   * @param validator
   * @param appContext What was originally provided from the app for it's context
   * @param stackPath The current path for the stack. Note that the because of cross-references and FHIRPath conformsTo() statements, the stack can wind through the content unpredictably. 
   * @param definition the definition being validated against (might be useful: ElementDefinition.base.path, ElementDefinition.type, ElementDefinition.binding
   * @param structure The structure definition that contains the element definition being validated against (may be from the base spec, may be from a profile)
   * @param kind The part of the binding being validated
   * @param valueSet The value set for the binding part that's being validated 
   * @param systems A list of canonical URls (including versions if known) of the systems in the instance that's being validated. Note that if a plain code is being validated, then there'll be no known system when this is called (systems will be empty, not null)
